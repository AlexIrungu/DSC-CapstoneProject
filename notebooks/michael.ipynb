    "<h2>Objective:</h2>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2>Key Questions:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "What factors contribute to loan defaults?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we predict which borrowers are likely to default based on their profile and loan details?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can the model be used to improve loan approval processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>2. Data Understanding</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Dataset Overview:</h2>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Data Exploration:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing Values: Some columns like GENDER, AGE, CREDIT_SCORE, and SCOREGRADE have missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Types: Most columns are numerical, but some like GENDER, EMPLOYMENT_STATUS, and LOAN_STATUS are categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Variable: LOAN_STATUS will be our target variable. We will classify loans as \"Default\" (Expired) or \"Non-Default\" (Current).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>3. Data Preparation</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Data Cleaning:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Handling Missing Values:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "For numerical columns like AGE we can fill missing values with the median or mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Irrelevant Columns: Columns like CURRENCY (since all loans are in KES) can be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables like GENDER, EMPLOYMENT_STATUS, and LOAN_STATUS into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Feature Engineering:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan-to-Income Ratio: Create a new feature by dividing the PRINCIPAL_AMOUNT by NET INCOME. This can help assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debt-to-Income Ratio: Calculate the ratio of EMI to NET INCOME.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overdue Ratio: Calculate the ratio of OD_DAYS to the loan tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Data Splitting:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>4. Modeling</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Model Selection:</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use classification algorithms to predict whether a borrower will default. Some common algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest\n",

    "\n",
    "By following the CRISP-DM framework, we have built a Loan Default Detection System that can help financial institutions in Kenya make better lending decisions. The model predicts whether a borrower is likely to default based on their profile and loan details, reducing the risk of bad loans and improving the overall health of the financial sector.\n"
